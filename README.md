# TileWatch - WIP
> "Finally, a [History](https://github.com/MarioE/History) alternative."

Support me & this plugin's (along with several others) development on Ko.Fi: [Here!](https://ko-fi.com/averageterraria)

TileWatch is an *experimental* alternative to the old-skool History plugin that has been resurrected update after update. History is now ancient, slow, bulky, and doesn't get updated anymore.
For those of you unaware of what History was, it allowed users & admins to quickly check tile history of each Terraria tile. You could see all the actions a user has done.
This was especially helpful for handling and punishing users for griefing. Another exceptional feature of the plugin was allowing users to quickly roll back user grief. 
This feature has saved me so many times, and is one I consider highly useful.

Now, TileWatch aims to bring you everything History did, with more. Faster, more efficiently, and more intuitively. 

> **TILEWATCH IS IN DEVELOPMENT STILL, it is NOT finished!**

## Dependencies
- [Auxiliary](https://github.com/Terraria-Builders-Community/Auxiliary/) - this is required for the plugin configuration, and utilization of MongoDB! Make sure to configure your `Auxiliary.json` config!
- [CSF.Net.TShock](https://github.com/Rozen4334/CSF.NET/releases/tag/v1.4.1) - we used this to handle commands, and it's used in a lot of our other plugins! Drop this in the `bin/` folder.
